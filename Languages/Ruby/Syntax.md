- Use two spaces per indentation level (aka soft tabs). No hard tabs.
- Don't use semicolon for single-line body
- Use :: only to reference constants(this includes classes and modules) and constructors. Never use :: for regular method invocation.
- Use def with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments.
- Prefer iterators to "for"
- For short conditions use ternary operator
- Use "unless" instead of "if not"
- Use "until" instead of "while not"
- Do not use "unless" with "else"
- Do not include ternary operator in other ternary operator
- Avoid of using "not" in assignment. Use "!" instead
- In conditional statements use "and", "or", "not"
- Use reversed "if/unless/while/until" modifiers for single-line body
- Don't use parentheses around the condition of an "if/unless/while/until"
- Keep "do" clause when using "while/until" for multi-line body
- Use "loop" instead of "while/until" when you need an infinite loop
- Omit parentheses when using Ruby native functions like "p", "puts", "attr_reader" etc
- Omit the outer braces around an implicit options hash
- Omit parentheses for method calls with no arguments
- Prefer {...} over do...end for single-line blocks
- Avoid return where not required for flow of control
- Avoid "self" where not required. Omit this rule only when calling custom attribute writer inside class
- Avoid shadowing variables with local variables unless they are both equivalent
- Add parentheses in conditional statement when you are using assignment operator inside
- Use shorthand self assignment operators whenever applicable
- Use "||=" to initialize variables only if they're not already initialized, except boolean variables
- Use "&&=" to preprocess variables that may or may not exist
- Try not to use equality operator. Instead you may use "is_a?", "zero?", "nil?", "=~" etc
- Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis
- Use the new lambda literal syntax for single line body blocks. Use the lambda method for multi-line blocks
- Prefix with _ unused block parameters and local variables
- Use $stdout/$stderr/$stdin instead of STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN
- Avoid single-line methods
- Use spaces around operators, except exponent operator
- Open and close hash body with spaces
- Do not add spaces to inline expression, eg "My name is #{name}"
- No spaces after "(", "[", "!" or before "]", ")"
- Add indent to "when" clause when using "case" statement
- Keep assignment easy and readable
- Put end of line around method definitions and class definition blocks.
- Avoid line continuation \ where not required
- When continuing a chained method invocation on another line keep the . on the second line.
- Align big chunk of method arguments, big hash or array in multiline. Put end of line around body
- It is preferred to add underscores to large numeric literals to improve their readability
- Don't use block comments
