Set branch name according to the rule:
`{category-prefix}/{subject}`

Where `{category-prefix}` one of
- refactoring (if main reason of this branch is to refactor code)
- bugfix (couple of code changes required to fix bug)
- markup or views (new view, markup, views decoration and so on)
- feature (new functionality unit developing)

In general case `{category-prefix}` is kind of thing which you are doing.

And where `{subject}` is that thing. See examples:

- refactoring/view-templates

- refactoring/excel-export

- bugfix/i18n-routing

- bugfix/menu-crash

- markup/login-popup

- views/seller-pages

- feature/facebook-auth

- feature/statistics
