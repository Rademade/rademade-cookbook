Set branch name according to the rule:
`{category-prefix}/{subject}`

Where `{category-prefix}` one of
- **refactor** (if main reason of this branch is to refactor code)
- **bugfix** (couple of code changes required to fix bug)
- **feature** (new functionality unit developing)

In general case `{category-prefix}` is kind of thing which you are doing.

And where `{subject}` is that thing. See examples:

- `refactor/view-templates`

- `refactor/excel-export`

- `bugfix/i18n-routing`

- `bugfix/menu-crash`

- `feature/facebook-auth`

- `feature/statistics`

Always use `-` (dash) as words delimiter.
